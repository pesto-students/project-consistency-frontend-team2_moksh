**Project Consistency is all about improving the productivity of users with the help of techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, Todo List, and Habits Tracker. With an in-built Pomodoro clock, the user can keep track of the time being consumed and can also improve the focus on task being performed. Users can add, edit, delete and mark completed tasks in their to-do list on daily basis. Â With an in-built habit tracker, users can keep track of their progress in their consistency of added habits. Users can also access their history of task completion and habits because that data is stored in a database.**
